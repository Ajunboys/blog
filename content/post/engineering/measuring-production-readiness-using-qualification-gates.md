So, you’re about to launch a product that will be used for business-critical use cases. Everyone speaks about being “production-ready,” and “enterprise-grade.” How can you make those vague concepts concrete?

There is an old saying that "You never get a second chance to make a first impression." In the enterprise storage world, the corollary is you never get a second chance tothe first time you mess with someone's data." (Frequently, a much stronger word than "mess" is used.) With Tardigrade, we are asking users to consider storing production data on a decentralized service--something that has never been done before. So, what does it mean to be "production grade" and how can you measure if you've achieved it?
